Alloy - Sublime PlugIn Alpha Version
====================

The target of this Sublime's plug in is help the Alloy-Titanium developers in order to have an autocompletion tool and a
Syntax highlight for the MVC model implemnted in Alloy.

Current Version
==================

The current version of this code only works for autocompletion code and syntax highlight of the TSS files. This is a modification
to the CSS-Plugin as work around and check if it is usable. I am working now in a new from zero plugin in order to do it 
better.


I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT
